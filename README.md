# Hand Gesture Controlled Mouse

## Description
This project implements a hand gesture-controlled mouse using computer vision techniques. The system tracks hand movements and interprets gestures to control mouse movements and clicks, allowing for a touchless and intuitive interface. It utilizes real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition to interact with the computer.

## Features
- **Real-time Hand Tracking:** Tracks hand movements using the webcam. <br />
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognizes specific hand gestures to perform mouse clicks and other actions.<br />
- **Mouse Control:** Controls the mouse pointer based on hand movements. <br />
- **Click and Drag:** Supports click and drag operations using gestures. <br />

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The core programming language used for development. <br />
- **OpenCV:** Used for capturing video from the webcam and processing images.<br />
- **Mediapipe:** Utilized for hand tracking and gesture recognition.<br />
- **PyAutoGUI:** Used to control the mouse and perform GUI automation.<br />
